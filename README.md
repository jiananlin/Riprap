# Riprap
Riprap Predict RNA structural disruptions induced by single nucleotide variants 

We introduce a novel computational frameworkâ€“RIboSNitch Predictor based on Robust Analysis of Pairing probabilities (Riprap). Riprap identifies structurally disrupted regions induced by any given SNVs based on robust analysis of local structural configurations between wild-type and mutant RNA sequences.
